Fraud Detection System
📚 Project Overview
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can distinguish fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones based on transactional data.
The dataset includes details such as transaction amount, user ID, merchant information, timestamps, and more, which are carefully preprocessed to identify key patterns indicating fraud.

✨ Goals:
Preprocess the transaction data effectively.

Identify key attributes that help in distinguishing fraudulent behavior.

Build and evaluate a robust fraud detection model.

Minimize false positives while maximizing fraud detection accuracy.

Explain misclassifications made by the model.

🗂️ Project Structure

File/Folder	Description
fraud_detection.ipynb	Main Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
data/	Folder containing the dataset files (transactions.csv, etc.).

⚙️ Setup Instructions
Follow the steps below to run this project locally on VS Code:

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
Activate it:

Windows:

bash
Copy
Edit
venv\Scripts\activate
Mac/Linux:

bash
Copy
Edit
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install the Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you don't have a requirements.txt, you can install major libraries manually:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
(You can later generate a requirements.txt by running pip freeze > requirements.txt.)

4. Launch VS Code
Open the project folder in VS Code, and open fraud_detection.ipynb.

If Jupyter is not installed, you can install it by:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install notebook
Then you can run:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook
or directly run cells inside VS Code if Jupyter Extension is installed.

🧠 Expected Outcome
A fraud detection model trained and evaluated.

A system that minimizes false positives (flagging legitimate transactions as fraud) and maximizes detection accuracy.

Analysis and explanation of misclassifications to understand model weaknesses.

📈 Future Improvements
Deployment as a real-time fraud detection API.

Use of advanced models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, Neural Networks).

Integration with a dashboard for visualization of transactions.
